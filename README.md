# Ionic Application
I worked on this project while I was at my internship. Me and my colleagues were working on an appointment application for a doctor. 
We used the Ionic Framework, and we worked in two teams, one for the frontend and one for the backend. I was the frontend team's lead developer, attending daily and weekly meetings and working on the project.Â
